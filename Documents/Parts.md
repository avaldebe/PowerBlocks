# Blocks, Modules and Assemblies
Blocks are independent units that can be easily combined to form
different devices. They are composed of Modules and Assemblies,
which are common to different Blocks and can be easily swapped/exchanged/replaced.
Modules are ready made items that can easily be purchased, such as a panel meter.
Assemblies DIY jigs made of common parts.

### 9v batteries
Rechargeable 9v (E) batteries are great for portable projects.
Recently 2S1P lipo batteries (7.4v) in 9v form factor have appeared,
aimed to the RC/FVP market. In addition to protection and balance circuitry,
they contain USB charging, charge indicator LEDs.

| connector | chemistry | voltage | capacity* | source        |
| ----      | ----      | ----    | ----      | ----          |
| DC jack   | lipo (2S) | 7.4 V |  5.92 Wh  | [$11][VR007]    |
| 9V snaps  | lipo (2S) | 7.4 V |  2.96 Wh  | [$13/2][OKcell] |
| 9V snaps  | NiMH      | 8.4 V |  1.68 Wh  | [$15][VARTA] |

* As usual with lipo batteries, the capacity claims are misleading/wrong... To be updated
